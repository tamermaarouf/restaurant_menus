# Full Stack Foundations
## Build a data-driven web app with Python
### In this course you will learn the fundamentals of back-end web development! 
### You will create your own web application that queries a database for items on restaurant menus and then dynamically generates complete menus in the form of web pages and API endpoints. 
### You’ll start by learning how to interact with a database from a web application using an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) layer. 
### From there, you’ll learn how GET and POST requests translate to CRUD operations. 
### You’ll then explore the Flask framework and the various ways in which it can speed up the development of your applications. 
### Finally, you’ll develop your very own web application from the ground up using the iterative development process.
